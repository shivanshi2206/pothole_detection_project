        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Potholes are a significant hazard to road users, causing accidents, vehicle damage, and economic losses. Traditional inspection methods are manual, time-consuming, and often miss emerging road issues. Delayed detection increases maintenance costs and risks for both governments and drivers.
